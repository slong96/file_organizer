# File Organizer
## Overview
This Python code organizes files within a specified directory based on their file extensions. It checks for the existence of the specified directory, prompts the user to input a valid path, and then categorizes files into folders corresponding to their extension names.

## Usage
Make sure Python is installed.

Ways to run the code:
- Run the code in a code editor (VS Code).
- On MacOS, right click on file_organizer.py, choose Python IDLE, click Run at the top, and click Run Module.
- On Windows, right click on file_organizer.py, choose Open with, and click Python.

Enter the path of the directory containing the unorganized files when prompted.

The code will organize the files by moving them into folders based on their extension names.

## Future Features
